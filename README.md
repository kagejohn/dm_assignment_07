# dm\_assignment\_07
The seventh assignment for Discrete Mathematics

Code contracts isn't fully updated for Visual Studio 2017 so i think what i have done works but i have not tested it.

For "Deposit" i have made 2 preconditions that check that the amount entered is above 0 and if not it tells you and throws and exception of the type "NegativeNumberException".

For "Withdraw" i have made 2 preconditions that check that the amount entered is above 0 and if not it tells you and throws and exception of the type "NegativeNumberException"

and i have made 2 postconditions that checks if the balance afterward is above or equal to 0 and if it isn't it tells you and throws and exception of the type "InsufficientFundsException".
